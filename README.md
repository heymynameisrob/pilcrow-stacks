# Pilcrow - A notebook app that writes at the speed of inspiration âœ¨

Last winter I was working on a PKM-style side-project of the same name. That didn't really work out but I learned a lot about how I write because of it.

Most people write to document things. The perception is you do all the thinking in your head and just 'get it down on paper'. But the reality is writing *is* the thinking. It opens up your mind to endless possibilities and new ideas.

Instead of our writing being a record on a page, it's more like a brush on a canvas. However, writing apps don't work like that.

So I'm building one that does.

## Features
- Simple, calm Notion-like editor without all the fluff and GenAI crap
- Create new documents instantly and view them in a 'stack', side-by-side, like pages in a book. 
- Run at the speed of inspiration! Notes stack up so you only view 3-at-a-time. You can only browse back and forth, like a real notebook.
- @ mention other documents to join up your thinking and create deep links between ideas when reading back
- CMK menu for actions
- Goto documents with keyboard shortcuts
- TODO: Upload rich media like video and images
- TODO: @ links can clear stack if CMD+Click
- TODO: Shareable read-only mode

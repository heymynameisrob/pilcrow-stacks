# Pilcrow - A notebook app that writes at the speed of inspiration ✨

Last winter I was working on a PKM-style side-project of the same name. That didn't really work out but I learned a lot about how I write because of it.

Most people write to document things. The perception is you do all the thinking in your head and just 'get it down on paper'. But the reality is writing *is* the thinking. It opens up your mind to endless possibilities and new ideas.

Instead of our writing being a record on a page, it's more like a brush on a canvas. However, writing apps don't work like that.

So I'm building one that does.
